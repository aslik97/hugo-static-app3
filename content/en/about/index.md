I'm a Master Mathematics **student** at TUM who works as a Cloud Solution Architect intern at **Microsoft** in Munich, Germany. You can take a look at my post about my journey at [Microsoft](/blog/ms_internship).

Some of Asli' free time activities are riding motorcycle, doing yoga, cooking, making ceramics, playing volleyball and camping. :
