At Microsoft, in the most open minded environment that one could ever wish for, I believe that everyone goes through their own journey... Therefore, I am writing my personal internship journey with how it pertains to my experiences.

## First Month: Onboarding
On my first day at Microsoft, I was told that, ‚Äúthe time at Microsoft will fly‚Äù. The best way I can describe my experience at Microsoft is through the book [‚ÄúMaking Time‚Äù.](https://www.stevenmtaylor.com/books/making-time/) The familiarity makes the time pass faster and the more information our minds take in, the slower time seems to pass. That being said, the combination of the familiarity and my learnings makes the time here at Microsoft a wonderful unique experience. When I reminisce 5 months ago, I feel like it was yesterday. Me  coming into the office the first time, so excited and curious about the things I will experience. There was so much information to take in that I felt like a child at the beginning. Well, I was the child in the sense that I was starting with a new chapter of my life with a lot of learnings, and the time seemed to be slow. But there were many like me and we were stepping into a new world together which enabled me to meet a lot of amazing supportive interns and amazing colleagues during my first weeks. By means of my dearest onboarding buddy and my mentor I felt the welcoming atmosphere and he was always supportive and showed me the way around.

Another quality that really helped me in the first days of my intern journey is being mindful. I have always tried to be in the moment and be ‚Äúmindful‚Äù with my experiences. My first weeks were full of new people, so much networking (more like virtual blind coffee dates and sometimes at the office), but the most important one: SO MANY LEARNINGS! I tried to absorb  as much as possible, but of course it‚Äôs never enough and that‚Äôs the best part. This is where I learnt that Microsoft does not only value learning, but also growing. 
The first weeks of October started fast, and I already collected a couple of goals to accomplish. I wanted to get the fundamentals exam for Azure [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900). I will explain later why this is important for me. I also had the pleasure to get my main task for my internship and started to shadow in some customer meetings. I also had the opportunity to participate in our team event in Tegernsee.

during my first month. There I got to know many amazing and inspiring people from our team. 
## Second Month: Passing my first Azure Certification
After this exciting starting month, I already had so much to do, but let‚Äôs go step by step. I had the opportunity to start organizing an internal team awarding process. And I wrote the exam AZ-900. I believe that even if it‚Äôs only a hands-off learning experience, I can only recommend the newbies to take it. It helps a lot for understanding the concepts and the relations for the further experiences during this never-ending journey. Throughout an assigned task from my manager, I had the pleasure to get to know so many other amazing people (even from different countries) with so many different perspectives in such a short time where I got more connected after this task with some of them.
## Third and the fourth Month: Building an App
Getting near to the new year, my main task started to shape itself. I was going to create an automated business process with Power Platform. The details and the concept were getting clearer. I chose the Power Platform (HUGE FAN ALERT) to accomplish the task from which I had no idea about before. So, a new journey with the chapter of Power Platform started.

 Kind of struggling putting this chapter into words‚Ä¶ I wanted to standardize an internal business process. To create a Power App controlled by a person who sends a questionnaire, collects information from various colleagues, puts in together and sends to distribution lists. In the end I needed a couple of platforms working together in harmony. But the task itself was challenging because this is not a regular use case for Power Apps. I needed to choose the right platforms to collaborate with. I had couple of options here from which I mostly didn‚Äôt know and had no experience before! After long research and selection process, I used the followings:
1.	A tool which creates the harmony between the platforms -> Microsoft Automate
2.	Questionnaire for various colleagues -> Microsoft Form
3.	Database -> Microsoft SharePoint 
4.	Visualization & Reporting -> Power Bi

Of course, there were a couple of other challenges during the creation of my app. I had to learn HTML to create a Newsletter Template and not everything worked as planned, but thanks to my awesome colleagues also from different departments, I had the opportunity to ask some of my questions spontaneously and to my mentor. Feeling lucky to have such colleagues around and have the opportunity to be a part of this community. The functionality of the Power App was already almost there through the end of January.
## Fifth Month : Other Tasks
 I started to present my app to some colleagues and collected their feedbacks and made changes, some more changes, A LOT OF CHANGES. Learnt that if you have an App, it is never perfect and there can always be a better version üòä.

  I prepared for an exam at the university in February (not recommended when you are working full time!). I got some tasks for customers and another Tipp for the newbies: You don‚Äôt get a task if you don‚Äôt ask for it, so go for it if you seek the opportunity! 

I also learned how to improve the public Azure Documentation by submitting a Pull Request. Very transparent process that is open to everyone: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/pull/88878.
## Sixth Month : Important Topics
Beginning march, I became an onboarding buddy myself. Such a pleasure to be able to show my learnings during onboarding and proudly show the culture of Microsoft!

There were also days when working was really hard. Especially during these hard times of Ukraine-Russia-War that started a month ago. I had to act and do something against the disaster other than just feeling the pain and staying at home. I find it important when such companies like Microsoft stand in situations like this and I was seeing the huge number of people willing to help, those affected by the war in Ukraine. There were a lot of ongoing internal initiatives happening. I wanted to use my skills to help and I saw the App initiative. This was where I was happy to support the internal app initiative with my learnings from Power Platform. I believe that like-minded people working together in such situations possess more force than individuals.

A lot of other things also happened this month. Shadowing different customer meetings, workshops and starting with a Power BI related project with a colleague from a different unit...

## Summary & What‚Äôs next?
As mentioned before, I believe that it is a never-ending journey if you love learning and helping others! I didn‚Äôt always mention it before but shadowing in customer meetings teach me a lot. At first my questions were not always making much sense üòä but continuing asking is kind of the key. 

I am a Cloud Solution Architect intern since October 2021 and I admire my position every day a little more. It is such a broad position that most of the Cloud Solution Architects define their position differently. Sometimes more technical and sometimes more strategic. This is why I am still learning my role and how I can ‚Äú‚Ä¶make others cool‚Äù-er! I am trying to understand everything during shadowing customer meetings and get some tasks afterwards. 

Back to the Power App I created, it is in the Beta-Test phase and plan is to release it in the next weeks. Right now, I am preparing for the next challenge to take the AZ-104 exam. Goal is to be able to have more knowledge in Azure and to take more tasks for the customers for their journey to Azure! But lets not forget,  ‚Äúthe road is more important than the goal‚Äù. 

So what‚Äôs next? My internship is going to end this month and I am going to continue as a Cloud Solution Architect working student. Plan is to be a part of such great projects with so many learnings!
